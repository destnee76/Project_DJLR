# Global Health Expenditure

## Analysis of the WHO’s Global Health Expenditure Database 2000-2020 (Dec. 2022 version)

### Summary: Analysis of the following questions:

* How does the population growth rate impact the percentage expenditure on healthcare?
* Do countries with a larger healthcare expenditure allocate more or less towards contraceptive management?
* Does the consumption expenditure impact the percentage of the GDP spent on healthcare?

### Credits

* [W.H.O. GHE CSV Download](https://apps.who.int/nha/database/Home/IndicatorsDownload/en) 
* [W.H.O Global Health Expenditure Database](https://apps.who.int/nha/database/Select/Indicators/en)

### Conclusion

* Working as a group to analyze, clean, and find a focus.
* Missing data on the GHE CSV, creating challenges when trying to accurately find correlations.
* Miscalculation with YoY population growth – created messy visuals and was difficult to diagnose

### Challenges

* There is no correlation between population growth rates and health expenditure. Between 1% to 3% of the population growth rate is responsible for a large percentage of total health spending. The analysis finds that 4% of the population with the highest health expenditures accounted for nearly half of total health spending in the world.
