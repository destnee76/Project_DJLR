**Challenges:**
Working as a group to analyze, clean, and find a focus.
 Missing data on the GHE CSV, creating challenges when trying to accurately find correlations.
Miscalculation with YoY population growth – created messy visuals and was difficult to diagnose. 

**Conclusion:**
There is no correlation between population growth rates and health expenditure. Between 1% to 3% of the population growth rate is responsible for a large percentage of total health spending. The analysis finds that 4% of the population with the highest health expenditures accounted for nearly half of total health spending in the world.
